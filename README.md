# WebsiteVideoGame
 
Considerations:
This project is currently being tested in a local server environment through XAMPP, .php files do not work through the standard methods for running HTML pages.

The download link for XAMPP is: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

Initialisation:
There are two requirements for this project to run:

1. A database called GamingDB must be present on the system.
  The current backup and initial .sql file that contains all commands is located in /WebsiteVideoGame/res/database.

2. The files must be located within a suitable server instance.
  I am currently developing within an Apache distribution that contains MariaDB, PHP, and Perl, XAMPP contains all required components. Ensure that XAMPP is running with   admin privileges and that both the 'MySQL' and 'Apache' modules are installed. They should have the green tick and be started. 
  
  The control panel for XAMPP.

Current State:
 Currently I am working through the form and how best to apply them within the current layout, this function is not built at this time.
